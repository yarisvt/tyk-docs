## What does it mean to create an API in Tyk
You have a running service with an API that you want your users to consume; you want to protect and manage access to that API using Tyk Gateway - how do you do that?  
<br>
For Tyk Gateway to protect and [reverse proxy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reverse_proxy) calls to your upstream service, you need to configure an API on Tyk Gateway. The minimum information that Tyk requires is the **listen path** (which is a path on the Tyk Gateway URL that you want your consumers to call) and your **API URL** (which is the URL of your service to which Tyk should forward requests).  
<br>
This information and other configuration values are stored in an object called a *Tyk API Definition*. Once you have created your Tyk API Definition and deployed it in the Gateway, Tyk can start serving your consumers, forwarding their requests to your upstream service's API.

To reach a detailed guide to creating Tyk API Definitions, please choose the tab for the product you are using:

{{< tabs_start >}}

{{< tab_start "Cloud" >}}
<br>
<br>
Tyk Cloud is the SaaS version of the Self-Managed product, though there are a few differences.  
<br>  
Please use the Tyk Cloud [Getting Started guide]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/getting-started-tyk-cloud/first-api" >}}) to create your first API.

{{< tab_start "Self-Managed" >}}
<br>
<br>
{{< include "create-api-include" >}}

If the command succeeds, you will see:
```json
{
  "action": "added",
  "key": "xxxxxxxxx",
  "status": "ok"
}
```

**What did we just do?**

We just sent an API definition to the Tyk `/apis` endpoint. See [API definition objects]({{< ref "tyk-gateway-api/api-definition-objects" >}}) for details of all the available objects. These objects encapsulate all of the settings for an API within Tyk.

**Note: Integration with your OpenAPI documentation**

In Tyk v4.1 we introduced support for APIs defined according to the [OpenAPI Specification v3.0.3](https://spec.openapis.org/oas/v3.0.3) (OAS).  
This introduces a standard way to describe the vendor-agnostic elements of an API (the OpenAPI Definition, stored as an OpenAPI Document); we take this and add Tyk-specific configuration options to create the *Tyk OAS API Definition*. You can import your own OpenAPI document and Tyk will use this to generate the Tyk OAS API Definition.  
For a detailed tutorial on using OAS with Tyk Gateway, check out our guide to [creating a Tyk OAS API Definition]({{< ref "getting-started/using-oas-definitions/create-an-oas-api#tutorial-create-an-oas-api-with-the-tyk-gateway-api" >}}).

## Prerequisites
Before you continue this tutorial, you will need a running [Tyk OSS gateway]({{< ref "tyk-oss-gateway" >}}). Click the button for instructions on how to install Tyk Gateway:

## Creating an API on Tyk Gateway
There are two ways to configure Tyk Gateway with an API definition:
1. [Create an API with the Tyk Gateway API]({{< ref "#tutorial-create-an-api-with-the-tyk-gateway-api" >}}) - Tyk Gateway has its own APIs which provides various services including the registering of Tyk API Definitions on the Gateway.
2. [Create an API in File-based Mode]({{< ref "#tutorial-create-an-api-in-file-based-mode" >}}) - alternatively you can create a Tyk API Definition in a file and then load it to the Gateway.


## Tutorial: Create an API with the Tyk Gateway API
Watch our video to learn how to add an API to Tyk's Open Source Gateway using [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

{{< youtube UWM2ZQoGhQA >}}

In order to use the Gateway API to create a Tyk API Definition you will need the API key for your deployment's Gateway API and then issue just one command to create the API and make it live.

### Step 1: Make sure you know your API secret
The API key to access your Tyk Gateway API is stored in your `tyk.conf` file; the property is called `secret`. You will need to provide this value in a header called `x-tyk-authorization` when making calls to the Gateway API.

### Step 2: Create an API
To create the API, let's send a Tyk API definition to the `/apis` endpoint on your Tyk Gateway. Remember to change the `x-tyk-authorization` value (API key) in the header of your API call and set the domain name and port to target your Tyk Gateway in the `curl` command.
```curl
curl -v -H "x-tyk-authorization: {your-secret}" \
  -s \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST \
  -d '{
    "name": "Hello-World",
    "slug": "hello-world",
    "api_id": "Hello-World",
    "org_id": "1",
    "use_keyless": true,
    "auth": {
      "auth_header_name": "Authorization"
    },
    "definition": {
      "location": "header",
      "key": "x-api-version"
    },
    "version_data": {
      "not_versioned": true,
      "versions": {
        "Default": {
          "name": "Default",
          "use_extended_paths": true
        }
      }
    },
    "proxy": {
      "listen_path": "/hello-world/",
      "target_url": "http://echo.tyk-demo.com:8080/",
      "strip_listen_path": true
    },
    "active": true
}' http://{your-tyk-host}:{port}/tyk/apis | python -mjson.tool
```

If the command succeeds, you will see:
```json
{
  "key": "Hello-World",
  "status": "ok",
  "action": "added"
}
```

{{< note success >}}
**Note**

All APIs deployed on Tyk Gateway are given a unique `API ID`; if you don't provide one in the Tyk API Definition when creating the API, then an `API ID` will be generated automatically.
{{< /note >}}

**What did we just do?**

We just registered a new API on your Tyk Gateway by sending a Tyk API definition to your Gateway's `/apis` endpoint.  
Tyk API definitions encapsulate all of the settings for an API within Tyk Gateway and are discussed in detail in the [API section]({{< ref "/tyk-gateway-api/api-definition-objects" >}}) of this documentation.

## Restart or hot reload

Once you have created the file, you will need to either restart the Tyk Gateway, or issue a hot reload command, lets do the latter:
```curl
curl -H "x-tyk-authorization: {your-secret}" -s http://{your-tyk-host}:{port}/tyk/reload/group | python -mjson.tool
```

This command will hot-reload your API Gateway(s) and the new API will be loaded, if you take a look at the output of the Gateway (or the logs), you will see that it should have loaded Hello-World API on `/hello-world/`.

## Tutorial: Create an API in File-based Mode

{{< note success >}}
**Note**

APIs created without API ID in file based mode are invalid.
{{< /note >}}


To create a file-based API definition is very easy.

Create a file called `api1.json` and place it in the `/apps` folder of your Tyk Gateway installation (usually in `/var/tyk-gateway`), then add the following:
```json
{
  "name": "Test API",
  "slug": "test-api",
  "api_id": "1",
  "org_id": "1",
  "auth_configs": {
    "authToken": {
      "auth_header_name": "Authorization"
    }
  },
  "definition": {
    "location": "header",
    "key": "x-api-version"
  },
  "version_data": {
    "not_versioned": true,
    "versions": {
      "Default": {
        "name": "Default",
        "use_extended_paths": true
    }
   }
  },
  "proxy": {
    "listen_path": "/test-api/",
    "target_url": "http://echo.tyk-demo.com:8080/",
    "strip_listen_path": true
  },
  "active": true
}
```

## Restart or hot reload

Once you have created the file, you will need to either restart the Tyk Gateway, or issue a hot reload command, lets do the latter:
```curl
curl -H "x-tyk-authorization: {your-secret}" -s https://{your-tyk-host}:{port}/tyk/reload/group | python -mjson.tool
```

This command will hot-reload your API Gateway(s) and the new API will be loaded, if you take a look at the output of the Gateway (or the logs), you will see that it should have loaded Test API on `/test-api/`.

Your API is now ready to use via the Gateway.
