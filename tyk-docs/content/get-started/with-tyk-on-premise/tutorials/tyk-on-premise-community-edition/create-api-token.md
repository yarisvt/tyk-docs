To create an API token, we will need the API ID that we wish to grant the token access to, then creating the token is a very simple API call to the endpoint.

**Prerequisite**

*   You will need your API secret, this is the `secret` property of the `tyk.conf` file.

Once you have this value, you can use them to access the Gateway API, the below `curl` command will generate a token for one of your APIs, remember to replace `{API-SECRET}`, `{API-ID}` and `{API-NAME}` with the real values as well as the `curl` domain name and port to be the correct values for your environment.

```
    curl -X POST -H "x-tyk-authorization: {API-SECRET}" 
     -s 
     -H "Content-Type: application/json" 
     -X POST 
     -d '{
        "allowance": 1000,
        "rate": 1000,
        "per": 1,
        "expires": -1,
        "quota_max": -1,
        "org_id": "1",
        "quota_renews": 1449051461,
        "quota_remaining": -1,
        "quota_renewal_rate": 60,
        "access_rights": {
            "{API-ID}": {
                "api_id": "{API-ID}",
                "api_name": "{API-NAME}",
                "versions": ["Default"]
            }
        },
        "meta_data": {}
     }' http://localhost:8080/tyk/keys/create | python -mjson.tool
```

You will see a response with your new token:

```
    {
        "action": "create",
        "key": "c2cb92a78f944e9a46de793fe28e847e",
        "status": "ok"
    }
```

The value returned in the `key` parameter of the response is the access token you can now use to access the API that was specified in the `access_rights` section of the call.
