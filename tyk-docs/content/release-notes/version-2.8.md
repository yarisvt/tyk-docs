## Looping

You now can configure complex request pipelines, allowing you to specify different actions for the same path, depending 
on defined conditions.

During URL rewrites, instead of rewriting to some HTTP endpoint, you now can tell Tyk to internally run its request 
pipeline one more time, but for another specified endpoint. In Tyk terms it called `looping` or adding a `loop`.  
In order to specify a `loop`, in the target URL, you should specify a string in the following format: `tyk://self/<path>`. 
You can loop to another API as well, by specifying the API name or id instead of `self`: `tyk://<api-id>/<path>`.

Combined with advanced URL rewriter rules, it can be turned into a powerful logical block, replacing the need for 
writing middleware or virtual endpoints in a lot of cases.

### Example

You have an endpoint, which will perform different logic depending on the specific header. In our case, for simplicity, 
it can be the `/get` endpoint which by default returns XML and if the `Accept` header in the request equals to 
`application/json` it returns a JSON response. With the new looping functionality you will need to define 2 endpoints: 

* /get - the endpoint the user hits, and which contains our logical block.
* /get-json - the internal endpoint, where you will loop to if the condition is met. It contains a body transform logic 
to rewrite XML response to JSON.

Inside the `/get` endpoint you add a URL rewrite plugin, with an advanced rule, which looks to see if the `Accept` header 
equals `application/json`, and rewrites the target to `tyk://self/get-json` URL.

Another example would be conditionally processing SOAP requests based on the content of the POST body. So you can define 
an individual request pipeline for each SOAP request, based on conditions defined in the URL rewriter rules.

---

## Debugger

You can now safely test all API changes, without publishing them, and visually see the whole request flow, including 
which plugins are running and even their individual logs.

We have added a new API designer tab called `Debugging`,  which provides a "Postman" like http client interface to 
simulate HTTP queries for the current API definition being edited.

You can even debug your virtual endpoints by dynamically modifying the code, sending the request via `Debugger` and 
watching for the virtual endpoint plugin logs.

---

## Separate rate limits and quotas per API within the same Policy

If you set the `Limits and Quotas per API` flag while configuring a policy, you will be able to configure separate rate 
limits and quotas per API.  

Note that you can’t mix this functionality with 
[partitioned policies](https://tyk.io/docs/security/security-policies/partitioned-policies/).

---

## Developer portal oAuth support

Developer portal now full supports exposing oAuth2 APIs:
* Developers can register their oAuth clients and see analytics
* Administrators can see list of oAuth clients from developer screen

---

## Multi-organization users

Now you can create users with the same email in different organizations. Such users will be able to select organization 
during login, and easily switch between organizations using navigation menu. To enable set 
`"enable_multi_org_users": true`.

---

## Request throttling

In cases of hitting quota or rate limits, Tyk Gateway now can automatically queue and auto-retry client requests. 
Throttling can be configured at a key or policy level via two new fields: `throttle_interval` and `throttle_retry_limit`. 

1. `throttle_interval`: Interval(seconds) between each request retry.
2. `throttle_retry_limit`: Total request retry number.

---

## Password policy improvements

* `security.user_password_max_days` Set the maximum lifetime of a password for a user. 
  They will be prompted to reset if a password lifetime exceeds the configured expiry value. 
  e.g. if the value is set to `30` any user password set over 30 days in past will be considered invalid and must be reset.
* `security.enforce_password_history` Set a maximum number of previous passwords used by a user that cannot be reused. 
  e.g. If set to `5` the user upon setting their password cannot reuse any of their 5 most recently used password for 
  that Tyk user account.
* `security.force_first_login_pw_reset` A newly created user will be forced to reset their password upon first login. 
  Defaults to `false`.

---

## Developer management improvements
* Now you can manually create developer subscriptions from developer screen.
* Added quick way to change subscription policy and reset quota
* All actions on developer screen now require only developer permissions 

---

## Key hashing improvements

Now you can enable updating keys by having only its hash. Controllable via `enable_update_key_by_hash` dashboard config variable.


## Ability to publish keyless APIs to the developer portal

You can now have the same Portal experience for your open APIs. All the functionality works the same, except for key 
  generation, which is disabled.

---

## Dynamic Portal Customisation

Portal templates now have access to the Developer object, its subscriptions, and issued key meta-data, providing the 
ability to conditionally show or hide content inside the Portal based on attributes mentioned below:

The Current logged in Developer can be accessed using the `.Profile` variable with the following fields:

* `Id` - Internal developer ID
* `Email` - Developer email
* `OrgID` - Tyk Organization ID
* `Subscriptions`  - Map containing subscriptions where the key is a policy ID and the value is an API key
* `Fields` - Map containing custom developer fields
* `OauthClients` - Map containing list of registered oAuth clients, where the key is the policy ID.

The Current logged in Developer detailed subscription object can be accessed using the `.APIS` variable, containing map, 
  where the key is a policy ID and the values in the following format: 

* `APIDescription` - API definition
    * `ID` - Internal API id
    * `Name` - API name
    * More fields: https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/blob/master/apidef/api_definitions.go#L320
* `APIKey` - API key
* `PolicyData` - Policy object
    * `ID` - Internal Policy ID
    * `Name` - Policy Name
    * More fields: https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk/blob/master/user/policy.go#L5
* `KeyMetaData` - Key meta data of map type

### Example

You have different teams of developers, and for each team we want to show them a different list of APIs. 
In this case, for each developer, we need to set a custom  `Team` field, and assert it in a template like this:

```
{{if eq .Profile.Fields.Team `internal`}}
    … Display internal set of APIs …
{{end}}
{{if eq .Profile.Fields.Team `public`}}
    … Display public set of APIs …
{{end}}
```

Similar functionality based on Key meta can look like:

```
{{range $pol, $subscription := .Data.APIS}}}}
   {{if eq $subscription.APIDescription.Name `test` }}
     {{if eq $subscription.KeyMetaData.Vip `1`}}
     …Show extended documentation for users having subscription with `vip` meta tag in token…
     {{end}}
   {{end}}
{{end}}
```

## Custom analytics storage engines for Multi-Cloud & Enterprise MDCB users

Multi-Cloud & Enterprise MDCB installations can now leverage the power of Tyk Pump and send analytics to custom sources 
like ElasticSearch or InfluxDB from within their local Data-Centers. 

The main idea is that you disable sending the Tyk Gateway analytics to the Multi-Cloud / Master layer from the Gateway 
itself, and by doing so, allow the Tyk Pump process to take care of it.

In order to do that, you need to: 

* Install Tyk Pump, with `hybrid` pump with the following configuration:

```
"hybrid": {
  "name": "hybrid",
  "meta": {
    "rpc_key": `<org-id>`,
    "api_key": `<api-key>`,
    "connection_string": `hybrid.cloud.tyk.io:9091`,
    "use_ssl": true,
    "ssl_insecure_skip_verify": false,
    "group_id": "",
    "call_timeout": 30,
    "ping_timeout": 60,
    "rpc_pool_size": 30
  }
}
```

* Enable Tyk Pump in the Tyk Gateway configuration, by changing `analytics_config.type` from `rpc` to an empty value.

Now you can add additional pumps to the Tyk Pump config.

## Dashboard Audit Log improvements

There is a new section in the Tyk Dashboard config file where you can specify parameters for audit log (contains audit records 
  for all requests made to all endpoints under `/api` route).

```
  ...
  "audit": {
    "enabled": true,
    "format": "json",
    "path": "/tmp/audit.log",
    "detailed_recording": false
  },
  ...
```

- `enabled` - enables audit logging, set to `false` by default. NOTE: setting the value `security.audit_log_path` has the same effect as setting `enabled` to `true`
- `format` - specifies the format of audit log file. Possible values are `json` and `text` (`text` is default value)
- `path` - specifies path to file with audit log, overwrites value `security.audit_log_path` if it was set
- `detailed_recording` - enables detailed records in the audit log, by default set to `false`. If set to `true` then audit log records will contain http-request (without body) and full http-response including body`

Audit record fields for `json` format:

 *   `req_id` - unique request ID
 *   `org_id` - organization ID
 *   `date` - date in `RFC1123` format
 *   `timestamp` - unix timestamp
 *   `ip` - IP address the request was originating from
 *   `user` - Dashboard user who performed the request
 *   `action` - description of action performed (`i.e. `Update User`)
 *   `method` - HTTP-method of the request
 *   `url` - URL of the request
 *   `status` - HTTP response status of the request
 *   `diff` - provides diff of changed fields (available only for PUT requests)
 *   `request_dump` - HTTP request copy (available if `detailed_recording` is set to `true`)
 *   `response_dump` - HTTP response copy (available if `detailed_recording` is set to `true`)
 
 If you specify `text` format - all fields are in plain text separated with new line and provided in the same order as fields for `json` format.

## Plugin bundler CLI tools now built-in to Tyk binary

Previously you had to use a separate `tyk-cli` binary to build bundles. 
The Command Behaviour remains the same, but instead of using `tyk-cli bundle` you now use `tyk bundle`.

---

## Basic Auth - Extract Credentials from Body

It is now possible to extract BasicAuth credentials from the request body. This is particularly useful in SOAP requests.

```text
<soapenv:Envelope
  ...
  <soapenv:Header>
    <aut:AuthenticationHeader>
      <aut:User>prova1234</aut:User>
      <aut:Pass>prova1234</aut:Pass>
    </aut:AuthenticationHeader>
  ...
```

You can modify your API definition to let Tyk know how to get the credentials:

```
...
"basic_auth": {
  "extract_from_body": true,
  "body_user_regexp": "<aut:User>(.*)</aut:User>",
  "body_password_regexp": "<aut:Pass>(.*)</aut:Pass>"
},
...
```

## Insecure Skip Verify on a per-api basis

Previously, it was possible to get Tyk Gateway to skip TLS verification globally (for ALL apis), but it was not possible to 
  enable this on a per-api basis. This meant that it was not previously possible to use self-signed certificates for 
  some APIs, and actual certs for others.
  
It is now possible to control which APIs use skip secure verification as follows within the API Definition object:

`api_definition.proxy.transport.ssl_insecure_skip_verify: bool` - Defaults to `false`.

Tyk's JSVM `TykMakeHttpRequest` function, will also respect the above configuration value.
