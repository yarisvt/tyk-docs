### Check the Health of the Gateway

To check your Gateway is set up properly and can proxy calls use the following call:

`GET /hello HTTP/1.1`

This will return the following:

```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

Hello Tiki
```

### Rename the /hello Endpoint

From v2.7.5 you can now rename the `/hello`  endpoint by using the `health_check_endpoint_name` option

### Check the Health of a Tyk Node and Upstream API

> **Note**: As of v2.4, the health-check API has been deprecated. We no longer recommend its use.

Tyk retains health data in Redis which reflects the current state of the API, in particular, the health-check API will return:

*   upstream latency average
*   requests per second 
*   throttles per second
*   quota violations per second
*   key failure events per second
