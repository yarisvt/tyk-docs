Configuring Tyk Pump is very simple.

Create a `pump.conf` file:


```{.json}

}
```



> **Note**: `mongo_ssl_insecure_skip_verify` and `mongo_use_ssl` are available from v1.3.6 onwards.

Pumps are then added to the `pumps` section of this document, each should represent a sink to purge the data into.

Settings must be the same as for the original `tyk.conf` for Redis and for MongoDB.

#### Elasticsearch Config
`index_name` - The name of the index that all the analytics data will be placed in. Defaults to "tyk_analytics"

`elasticsearch_url` - If sniffing is disabled, the URL that all data will be sent to. Defaults to `http://localhost:9200`. The HTTP prefix must be included in the URL.

`enable_sniffing` - If sniffing is enabled, the `elasticsearch_url` will be used to make a request to get a list of all the nodes in the cluster. The returned addresses will then be used. Defaults to `false`.

`document_type` - The type of the document that is created in ES. Defaults to "tyk_analytics"

`rolling_index` - Appends the date to the end of the index name, so each days data is split into a different index name. E.g. tyk_analytics-2016.02.28 Defaults to false

`extended_stats` - If set to true will include the following additional fields: Raw Request, Raw Response and User Agent.

`version` - Specifies the ES version. Use "3" for ES 2.x, and "5" for ES 5.0. Defaults to "3".

#### Moesif Config
Moesif is a logging and analytics service for APIs. The Moesif pump will move analytics data from Tyk to Moesif.

`application_id` - Moesif App Id JWT. Multiple api_id's will go under the same app id.

#### Hybrid RPC Config
Pump type `hybrid` is used to send your analytics data to MDCB via RPC.

NOTE: Make sure your tyk.conf has `analytics_config.type` set to empty string value.

`rpc_key` - Put your organization ID in this field.

`api_key` - This the API key of a user used to authenticate and authorise the Gateway's access through MDCB. The user should be a standard Dashboard user with minimal privileges so as to reduce risk if compromised. The suggested security settings are `read` for `Real-time notifications` and the remaining options set to `deny`.

`connection_string` - The MDCB instance or load balancer.

`use_ssl` - Set this field to `true` if you need secured connection (default value is `false`).

`ssl_insecure_skip_verify` - Set this field to `true` if you use self signed certificate.

`group_id` - This is the "zone" that this instance inhabits, e.g. the DC it lives in. It must be unique to each slave cluster / DC.

`call_timeout` - This is the timeout (in milliseconds) for RPC calls.

`rpc_pool_size` - This is maximum number of connections to MDCB.

### Capping analytics data

Tyk Gateways can generate a lot of analytics data. A guideline is that for every 3 million requests that your Gateway processes it will generate roughly 1GB of data.

If you have Tyk Pump set up with the aggregate pump as well as the regular MongoDB pump, then you can make the `tyk_analytics` collection a [capped collection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/capped-collections/). Capping a collection guarantees that analytics data is rolling within a size limit, acting like a FIFO buffer which means that when it reaches a specific size, instead of continuing to grow, it will replace old records with new ones.

The `tyk_analytics` collection contains granular log data, which is why it can grow rapidly. The aggregate pump will convert this data into a aggregate format and store it in a separate collection. The aggregate collection is used for processing reporting requests as it is much more efficient.

If you've got an existing collection which you want to convert to be capped you can use the `convertToCapped` [MongoDB command](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/command/convertToCapped/).

If you wish to configure the pump to cap the collections for you upon creating the collection, you may add the following
configurations to your `uptime_pump_config` and / or `mongo.meta` objects in `pump.conf`.

```
"collection_cap_max_size_bytes": 1048577,
"collection_cap_enable": true
```

`collection_cap_max_size_bytes` sets the maximum size of the capped collection.
`collection_cap_enable` enables capped collections.

If capped collections are enabled and a max size is not set, a default cap size of `5Gib` is applied. 
Existing collections will never be modified.

### Environment variables

Environment variables can be used to override settings defined in the configuration file. The [Tyk Pump environment variables page](/docs/configure/pump-env-variables/) shows how the JSON member keys map to the environment variables. Where an environment variable is specified, its value will take precedence over the value in the configuration file.
