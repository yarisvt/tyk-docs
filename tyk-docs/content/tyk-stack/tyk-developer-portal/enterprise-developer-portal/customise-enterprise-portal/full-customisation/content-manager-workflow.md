## Introduction
For organisations with content manager(s) managing the developer portal content, we are recommending the following workflow.

{{< img src="/img/dashboard/portal-management/enterprise-portal/portal-content-manager-flow.png" alt="Content manager workflow" >}}

The Tyk Developer portal supports the workflow of content managers who're responsible for editing and managing page content.
The purpose of highlighting this flow is to give recommendations on how to organise effective workflows between front end engineers and content managers. Where front end engineers are building page templates and content managers are managing the pages and the content.
