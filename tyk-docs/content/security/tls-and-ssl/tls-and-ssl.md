Tyk supports TLS connections, and as of version 2.0 all TLS connections will also support HTTP/2. To enable SSL in your Tyk Gateway and Dashboard, you will need to modify the `tyk.conf` and `tyk_analytics.conf` files to include a server options section like so:

```{.copyWrapper}
"http_server_options": {
  "use_ssl": true,
  "server_name": "yoursite.com",
  "min_version": 771,
  "certificates": [
    {
      "domain_name": "*.yoursite.com",
      "cert_file": "./new.cert.cert",
      "key_file": "./new.cert.key"
    }
  ]
},
```
    

You can enter multiple certificates, that link to multiple domain names, this enables you to have multiple SSL certs for your gateways or dashboard domains if they are providing access to different domains via the same IP.

The `min_version` setting is optional, you can set it to have Tyk only accept connections from TLS V1.0, 1.1 and 1.2 respectively.

#### Values for TLS Versions

You need to use the following values for setting the TLS `min_version`:

| TLS Version   | Value to Use   |
|---------------|----------------|
|      1.0      |      769       |
|      1.1      |      770       |
|      1.2      |      771       |


#### Specify TLS Cipher Suites

You can optionally add the additional `http_server_options` config option `ssl_ciphers` which takes an array of strings as its value.

Each string must be one of the allowed cipher suites as defined at https://golang.org/pkg/crypto/tls/#pkg-constants

For example:

```{.copyWrapper}
"http_server_options": {
  "ssl_ciphers": [
    "TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256", 
    "TLS_ECDHE_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA"
  ]
},
```

### Using Tyk Certificate Storage
In Tyk Gateway 2.4 and Tyk Dashboard 1.4 we added [Mutual TLS support](https://tyk.io/docs/security/tls-and-ssl/mutual-tls/) including special Certificate storage, which is used to store all kinds of certificates from public to server certificates with private keys.

In order to add new server certificates:

1. Ensure that both private key and certificates are in PEM format
2. Concatenate Cert and Key files to single file
3. Go to "Certificates" section of the Tyk Dashboard, upload certificate, and you will get a unique ID response
4. Set it to the Tyk Gateway using one of the approaches below:

* Using tyk.conf:
  
```
     "http_server_options": {
        "ssl_certificates": ["<cert-id-1>", "<cert-id-2>"]
     }
```
  
  * Using environmental variables (handy for Multi-Cloud installation and Docker in general): `TYK_GW_HTTPSERVEROPTIONS_SSLCERTIFICATES=<cert-id>` (if you want set multiple certificates just separate them using comma)
  
The Domain in this case will be extracted from standard certificate fields: `Subject.CommonName` or `DNSNames`.

> **Note**: this approach only works with the Tyk Gateway at present. Dashboard support has not been implemented yet.

### Dynamically setting SSL certificates for custom domains

If you include certificateID or certificate path to API definition `certificates` field, Gateway will dynamically load this ceritficate for your custom domain, so you will not need to restart the process. You can do it from Dashboard UI too, in custom domain section.
