## <a name="what-is-basic-auth"></a>What is Basic Authentication?

> In the context of an HTTP transaction, basic access authentication is a method for an HTTP user agent to provide a user name and password when making a request. HTTP Basic authentication (BA) implementation is the simplest technique for enforcing access controls to web resources because it doesn’t require cookies, session identifiers, or login pages; rather, HTTP Basic authentication uses standard fields in the HTTP header, obviating the need for handshakes. (Source: wikipedia)

Basic Authentication is a standard authentication mechanism supported by every standards-compliant HTTP server, it is also supported by almost every single web browser, which makes it an excellent access control method for smaller APIs.

However, a serious drawback of Basic Authentication is that credentials are transferred in encoded plain text over the wire, this can be a serious concern for API owners and should therefore only ever be used in conjunction with TLS such as SSL.

A basic authentication request will have an Authorization header where the value will be in the form of:

```
Basic base64Encode(username:password)
```

This means a real request would look something like:

```
GET /api/widgets/12345 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost:8080
Authorization: Basic am9obkBzbWl0aC5jb206MTIzNDU2Nw==
Cache-Control: no-cache
```

In the above example the username is `john@smith.com` and the password is `1234567`.

Tyk supports using basic authentication as an access key in the same way as any other access method.

## <a name="with-dashboard"></a>Enable Basic Authentication in your API Definition with the Dashboard

To enable Basic Authentication on your API using the Tyk Dashboard:

1. Select your API from the **System Management > APIs** menu
2. Scroll to the **Authentication** options
3. Select **Basic Auth** from the drop-down list
4. Select **Strip Authorization Data** to strip any authorization data from your API requests.

## <a name="with-file-based"></a>Enable Basic Authentication in your API Definition with file-based

To enable Basic Authentication, the API Definition file needs to be set up to allow basic authentication and not a standard access token:

```{.copyWrapper}
{
  "name": "Tyk Test API",
  ...
  "use_basic_auth": true,
  ...
}
```

As you can see in the above example, enabling basic authentication is as simple as setting a flag for the feature in your API Definition object. Since BA is a standard, Tyk will always look for the credentials as part of the Authorization header.

## <a name="create-basic-auth-key"></a>Create a Key with Basic Authentication

We have tutorials for [creating an API Key](/docs/get-started/with-tyk-on-premise/tutorials/tyk-on-premises-pro/create-api-token/) via the Dashboard. To use with Basic Authentication, select the **Basic Authentication** option.

![Keys Basic Auth][2]

## <a name="create-a-basic-auth-user"></a>Create a Basic Authentication User

For a user session object, to enable basic authentication set the relevant fields in the session object:

```{.copyWrapper}
{
  ...
  "basic_auth_data": {
      "password": "mickey-mouse"
  }
  ...
}
```


Notice the `basic_auth_data` section - this is all that is really required.If an API is basic authentication enabled, any keys that are retrieved will check this field for a password and compare it to the password encoded in the request. The password will be encrypted by default using bcrypt to ensure it is secure.

> **Note**: Basic authentication keys are not created the same way as other keys. Since the key ID is not generated by the system a basic authentication key cannot use the `/tyk/keys/create` endpoint, and instead should `POST` to `/tyk/keys/{username}` of the Tyk Gateway API. This will *ADD* a key to the system. Subsequent requests will overwrite this entry, sending a `PUT` request will update the entry.

### Create a Basic Authentication User using the Gateway API

The below command will use the Tyk Gateway API to create a new basic authentication user in the Tyk Gateway:

```{.copyWrapper}
curl -X POST -H "x-tyk-authorization: 352d20fe67be67f6340b4c0605b044c3" \
 -s \
 -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
 -X POST \
 -d '{
    "allowance": 1000,
    "rate": 1000,
    "per": 1,
    "expires": -1,
    "quota_max": -1,
    "org_id": "53ac07777cbb8c2d53000002",
    "quota_renews": 1449051461,
    "quota_remaining": -1,
    "quota_renewal_rate": 60,
    "access_rights": {
        "{API-ID}": {
            "api_id": "{API-ID}",
            "api_name": "{API-NAME}",
            "versions": ["Default"]
        }
    },
    "meta_data": {},
    "basic_auth_data": {
        "password": "mickey-mouse"
    }
 }' http://{your-tyk-gateway-host}:{port}/tyk/keys/testuser | python -mjson.tool
```

### Create a Basic Authentication User using the Dashboard API

The following command will create a basic authentication  user with the Tyk Dashboard API:

```{.copyWrapper}
curl -X POST -H "Authorization: {YOUR API KEY}"
 -s
 -H "Content-Type: application/json"
 -X POST
 -d '{
    "allowance": 1000,
    "rate": 1000,
    "per": 1,
    "expires": -1,
    "quota_max": -1,
    "org_id": "53ac07777cbb8c2d53000002",
    "quota_renews": 1449051461,
    "quota_remaining": -1,
    "quota_renewal_rate": 60,
    "access_rights": {
      "{API-ID}": {
        "api_id": "{API-ID}", 
        "api_name": "{API-NAME}", 
        "versions": [
            "Default"
        ]
      }
    },
    "meta_data": {},
    "basic_auth_data": {
      "password": "mickey-mouse"
    }
 }' http://{your-tyk-gateway-host}:{port}/api/apis/keys/basic/mysupertestuser2 | python -mjson.tool
```

> **Note**: The most important thing to ensure with both of these commands is that the ORG ID is set correctly and consistently.
