Open source is at the heart of what we do. Anything that is API Gateway-related, lives in the Gateway, or is critical for the Gateway to work is open and freely available via our [Github](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/).

Our commitment to open source also delivers a host of benefits for our users: signup for free with Tyk, receive securely packaged open source packages, getting started guides, access to our community and all of the latest open source information.

If you are new to Tyk API Gateway or just want to quickly take it for a spin in just 3 steps, head over to our [quick start guide]({{< ref "deployment-and-operations/tyk-open-source-api-gateway/quick-start" >}}). If you want to deploy it in a specific platform check our [installation options]({{< ref "apim/open-source/installation" >}}) page.


Please show your support for the Gateway by clicking the GitHub link, then adding your star.
