If you've seen the documentation for the log viewer, then you'll also be wondering how to set up your Tyk configuration to enable detail request logging.

### What is detailed request logging?

When this mode is enabled, Tyk will record the request in wire-format and the response in wire-format in the analytics DB. This can be very useful when trying to debug API requests to see what went wrong for a user or client.

> **NOTE**: As of v3.0, detailed logging is not available for Tyk Cloud customers.

### Enabling Detail Logging

To enable detail logging is very simple, just enable the setting in your `tyk.conf` file:

```{.copyWrapper}
"analytics_config": {
  "enable_detailed_recording": true
}
```

You will need to restart the Gateway in order for this to work.

You will also need Tyk Pump configured to move your data into your preferred data store.
