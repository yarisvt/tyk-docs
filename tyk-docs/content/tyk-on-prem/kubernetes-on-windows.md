**Note**
  
Installing Tyk on Kubernetes requires a multi-node Tyk licence. If you are evaluating Tyk on Kubernetes, [contact us](https://tyk.io/about/contact/) to obtain an temporary licence.

**Warning**  

This deployment is NOT designed for production use or performance testing. The Tyk Pro Docker Demo is our full, [Self-Managed]({{< ref "/content/tyk-self-managed/install.md" >}}) solution, which includes our Gateway, Dashboard and analytics processing pipeline. 

This demo will run Tyk On-Premises on your machine, which contains 5 containers: Tyk Gateway, Tyk Dashboard, Tyk Pump, Redis and either MongoDB or one of our supported [SQL databases]({{< ref "/content/tyk-dashboard/database-options.md" >}}).

This demo is great for proof of concept and demo purposes, but if you want to test performance, you need to move each component to a separate machine.

**Note**  

You use this at your own risk. Tyk is not supported on the Windows platform. However you can test it as a proof of concept using our Pro Demo Docker installation.

* Docker Desktop for Windows 2.2.0.0 (Docker engine v19.03.5)
* helm v3.0.3
* minikube v1.7.1 (k8s v 1.17.2)
* kubectl v 1.17.0 (Note that kubectl is packaged with Docker Desktop for Windows, but the version may be incompatible with k8s)
