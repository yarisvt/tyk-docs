Ingress is an API object that manages external access to the services in a cluster, typically HTTP (source [kubernetes.io - ingress](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/services-networking/ingress/)).
**Tyk Operator** offers an [Ingress Controller]({{<ref "product-stack/tyk-operator/tyk-ingress-controller">}}), which dynamically manages Tyk ApiDefinition resources as per the ingress spec. 
This way your **Tyk Gateway** is configured as a drop-in replacement for a standard Kubernetes Ingress. 

**Tyk Operator** is also the preferred way to use Tyk for users who follow GitOps standards. It enables Tyk to be used for managing API Definitions, security policies and other Tyk features.
