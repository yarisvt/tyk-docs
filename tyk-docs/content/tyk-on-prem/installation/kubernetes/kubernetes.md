## Installing Tyk

The main ways to install *Tyk Self-Managed* in a Kubernetes cluster are via Helm charts or via Kubernetes manifest files.

### Tyk Helm Charts
This is the preferred way to install Tyk Self-Managed Pro on Kubernetes. 
We are actively working to add flexibility and more user flows to our chart. Please reach out
to our teams on support or the cummunity forum if you have questions, requests or suggestions for improvements.
Go to [Tyk Helm Charts]({{< ref "/content/tyk-on-prem/installation/kubernetes/helm-chart.md" >}}) for detailed installation instructions.

### Kubernetes manifest files
You can also install Tyk using Kubernetes manifest file. The [GH repository](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-k8s) 
that assist with this method is currently inactive, but you can get advice and help via the 
support team or the [Tyk community forum](https://community.tyk.io/).

## Tyk Operator and Ingress 
For a GitOps workflow used with a **Tyk Self-Managed** installation or setting the Tyk Gateway as a Kubernetes ingress controller, Tyk Operator enables you to manage API definitions, security policies and other Tyk features using Kubernetes manifest files.
