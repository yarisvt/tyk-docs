## 5.0.2 Release Notes

##### Release Date 29 May 2023

#### Release Highlights

##### Support for MongoDB 5 and 6
From Tyk 5.0.2, we added support for MongoDB 5.0.x and 6.0.x. To enable this, you have to set new Dashboard config option driver to *mongo-go*. 
The driver setting defines the driver type to use for MongoDB. It can be one of the following values:
- [mgo](https://github.com/go-mgo/mgo) (default): Uses the *mgo* driver. This driver supports MongoDB versions <= v4.x (lower or equal to v4.x). You can get more information about this driver in the [mgo](https://github.com/go-mgo/mgo) GH repository. To allow users more time for migration, we will update our default driver to the new driver, *mongo-go*, in next major release.
- [mongo-go](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver): Uses the official MongoDB driver. This driver supports MongoDB versions >= v4.x (greater or equal to v4.x). You can get more information about this driver in [mongo-go-driver](https://github.com/mongodb/mongo-go-driver) GH repository.

See how to [Choose a MongoDB driver]({{< ref "planning-for-production/database-settings/mongodb#choose-a-mongodb-driver" >}})

**Note: Tyk Pump 1.8.0 and MDCB 2.2 releases have been updated to support the new driver option**

## v5.0.0 Release Notes

##### Release Date 28 Mar 2023

#### Release Highlights

##### Improved OpenAPI support

Tyk Dashboard has been enhanced with **all the custom middleware options** for Tyk OAS APIs, so **for the first time** you can configure your custom middleware from the Dashboard; this covers the full suite of custom middleware from pre- to post- and response plugins. We’ve got support for middleware bundles, Go plugins and Tyk Virtual Endpoints, all within the new and improved Tyk Dashboard UI.

[Versioning your Tyk OAS APIs]({{< ref "getting-started/key-concepts/oas-versioning" >}}) is easier than ever, with the Tyk OSS Gateway now looking after the maintenance of the list of versions associated with the base API for you; we’ve also added a new endpoint on the Tyk API that will return details of the versions for a given API.

Tyk Dashboard hasn’t been left out, we’ve implemented a brand new version management UI for Tyk OAS APIs, to make it as easy as possible for you to manage those API versions as you develop and extend your API products with Tyk.

We’ve improved support for [OAS Mock Responses]({{< ref "getting-started/using-oas-definitions/mock-response" >}}), with the Tyk OAS API definition now allowing you to register multiple Mock Responses in a single API, providing you with increased testing flexibility.

Another new feature in the Tyk OAS API Designer is that you can now update (PATCH) your existing Tyk OAS APIs through the Dashboard API without having to resort to curl. That should make life just that little bit easier.
Of course, we’ve also addressed some bugs and usability issues as part of our ongoing ambition to make Tyk OAS API the best way for you to create and manage your APIs.

##### GraphQL and Universal Data Graph improvements

This release is all about making things easier for our users with GraphQL and Universal Data Graph.

In order to get our users up and running with a working Universal Data Graph quickly, we’ve created a repository of examples that anyone can import into their Dashboard or Gateway and see what Universal Data Graph is capable of. Import can be done in two ways:
- manually, by simply copying a Tyk API definition from GitHub - [TykTechnologies/tyk-examples](https://TykTechnologies/tyk-examples): A repository containing example API definitions and policies for Tyk products. 
- via command line [using tyk-sync]({{< ref "universal-data-graph/udg-examples" >}})

To make it easier for our users to find their way to Universal Data Graph, we’ve also given it its own space in the Dashboard. From now on you can find UDG under Data Graphs section of the menu.

It also got a lot easier to turn a Kafka topic into a GraphQL subscription. Using our new Dashboard API endpoint, users will be able to transform their AsyncAPI documentation into Universal Data Graph definition with a single click. Support for OAS coming soon as well!

With this release we are also giving our users [improved headers for GQL APIs]({{< ref "graphql/gql-headers" >}}). It is now possible to use context variables in request headers and persist headers needed for introspection separately for improved security.

Additionally we’ve added Dashboard support for introspection control on policy and key level. It is now possible to allow or block certain consumers from being able to introspect any graph while creating a policy or key via Dashboard.
