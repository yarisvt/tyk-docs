### Support Lifetime
We strive to avoid any long-term support arrangements for our enterprise portal. We run a regular 6-week release cadence which delivers new capability, extension of existing capability, and bug fixes. Our policy is that we aim to avoid any breaking changes, so in effect, the entire enterprise portal is supported. Here we'd increment our version as a minor version - 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.0 etc.

Occasionally, we may see a need to issue a critical fix if there is a system down or a critical security defect. Here we would release this as soon as is physically possible and the semantic versioning would reflect a patch (1.3.1, 1.4.1 etc).

The only exception to this policy is if we ever need to release a breaking change. This would mean that we have to release a new major version (i.e. releasing version 2.0). In this exceptional circumstance we would support both the old major version and the new one concurrently for six months - please note that the old version only gets supported in terms of critical fixes, not new functionality. After six months, the previous major version falls out of support.

- Fixed the bug where the Exports function didn't export analytics to a CSV file under the Error rate(average) tab in the developer Dashboard.
- Fixed the bug where the portal did not accept themes with names containing dots and displayed a not found error when uploading a theme with a dot in its name.
- Fixed the bug in a multi-pod deployment where, when a theme is uploaded, only the pod that uploaded it updates its theme list, while the other pods remain unaware of the new theme.
- Fixed the bug where the portal's Page menu allowed to pages with duplicated names of content-blocks leading to only one of the blocks being displayed.
- Fixed the bug where the portal's page renderer ignored content-blocks under the `if` statement with references to multiple content-blocks (e.g. `{{ if and .blocks.Block1.Content .blocks.Block2.Content .blocks.Block3.Content }}`).
