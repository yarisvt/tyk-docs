### Support Lifetime
We strive to avoid any long term support arrangements for our enterprise portal. We run a regular 6 week release cadence which delivers new capability, extension of existing capability, and bug fix. Our policy is that we aim to avoid any breaking changes, so in effect the entire enterprise portal is supported. Here we'd increment our version as a minor version - 1.3.0, 1.4.0, 1.5.0 etc.

Occasionally, we may see a need to issue a critical fix if there is a systems down or a critical security defect. Here we would release this as soon as is physically possible, and the semantic versioning would reflect a patch (1.3.1, 1.4.1 etc).

The only exception to this policy is if we ever need to release a breaking change. This would mean that we have to release a new major version (i.e. releasing version 2.0). In this exceptional circumstance we would support both the old major version and the new one concurrently for six months - please note that the old version only gets supported in terms of critical fixes, not new functionality. After the six months is up, the previous major version falls out of support.

##### Release Date 2 June 2023

#### Breaking Changes

#### Future breaking changes
This release doesn't introduce future breaking changes.

#### Deprecations
There are no deprecations in this release.

#### Upgrade instructions
If you are on a 1.3.0 or an older version we advise you to upgrade ASAP directly to this release.

## Release Highlights
#### SQL support for the portal’s assets
Until recently, SQL storage was not supported for the portal’s assets: OAS files, themes, images, etc. Therefore, customers had to use at least two types of storage:
- SQL for the portal’s metadata (users, products, access requests, etc).
- Filesystem or S3 for assets (pictures, themes, etc).

This is especially inconvenient in Kubernetes environment when customers had to use persistent volumes.
With this new feature, customers can simply use the same SQL database (MySQL, MariaDB and PostgreSQL) for both assets and metadata. To use the `db` [storage type]({{< ref "/content/product-stack/tyk-enterprise-developer-portal/deploy/configuration.md#portal_storage" >}}) just set the `PORTAL_STORAGE=db` for environment variables or `"Storage": "db"` in a config file and you are good to go!

#### Response status code added to API analytics filters
API Consumers now can filter API analytics by response status codes. This allows them to analyse traffic and error rate for specific response code for their API Products.

#### Displaying Basic Auth APIs
We introduced display-only support for basic APIs. That means API Providers can publish documentation for the basic auth APIs. However, developers cannot use the portal to get access to the basic auth APIs.

## Download
- [docker image to pull](https://hub.docker.com/layers/tykio/portal/v1.4.0/images/sha256-11af93300ae91962e9af84ecec0e78b6cf5972521f0655273b48a7e551df3c84?context=explore)

## Changelog
#### Added
- Added SQL support for the portal's assets to simplify the storage configuration. Now our customers can store all data in one database.
- Added response status code filters in the API analytics for developers to enhance self-service capabilities for developers.
- Added displaying Basic Auth APIs so that API Providers can expose on the portal their APIs that use basic auth for documentation purposes.
- Added input validation for organization name to prevent organization with empty names from being created.

#### Fixed
- Fixed typo in the name of the demo user.
- Rewritten labels for Auth token credentials to remove customers' confusion with opaque names of fields.

## Security Fixes
- [ZipSlip vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-27475) in the theme upload flow is now resolved.
- Added input validation for preventing XSS attacks for catalogues and organisations in the admin app.
