## Introduction

This tutorial will guide you through the creation of a custom authentication plugin for Tyk with a gRPC based plugin with .NET and C#.

For additional information about gRPC, check the official documentation [here](https://grpc.io/docs/guides/index.html).

## Requirements

* Tyk Gateway: This can be installed using standard package management tools like Yum or APT, or from source code. See [here][1] for more installation options.
* The Tyk CLI utility, which is bundled with our RPM and DEB packages, and can be installed separately from [https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-cli][2]
* In Tyk 2.8 the Tyk CLI is part of the gateway binary, you can find more information by running "tyk help bundle".
* .NET Core for your OS: https://www.microsoft.com/net/core
* gRPC tools: https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/csharp.html#generate-grpc-code


## What is gRPC?

gRPC is a very powerful framework for RPC communication across different languages. It was created by Google and makes heavy use of HTTP2 capabilities and the Protocol Buffers serialisation mechanism.

## Why Use it for Plugins?
When it comes to built-in plugins, we have been able to integrate several languages like Python, Javascript & Lua in a native way: this means the middleware you write using any of these languages runs in the same process. For supporting additional languages we have decided to integrate gRPC connections and perform the middleware operations outside of the Tyk process. The flow of this approach is as follows: 

* Tyk receives a HTTP request.
* Your gRPC server performs the middleware operations (for example, any modification of the request object).
* Your gRPC server sends the request back to Tyk.
* Tyk proxies the request to your upstream API.

The sample code that we'll use implements a very simple authentication layer using .NET and the proper gRPC bindings generated from our Protocol Buffers definition files.

## Create the Plugin

### Setting up the .NET Project

We use the .NET CLI tool to generate the initial files for our project:

```{.copyWrapper}
cd ~
dotnet new console -o tyk-plugin
```

We now have a `tyk-plugin` directory containing the basic skeleton of a .NET application.

From the `tyk-plugin` directory we need to install a few packages that the gRPC server requires:

```{.copyWrapper}
dotnet add package Grpc --version 1.6.0
dotnet add package System.Threading.ThreadPool --version 4.3.0
dotnet add package Google.Protobuf --version 3.4.0
```

* The `Grpc` package provides base code for our server implementation.
* The `ThreadPool` package is used by `Grpc`.
* The `Protobuf` package will be used by our gRPC bindings.

### gRPC Tools and Bindings Generation

We need to install the gRPC tools to generate the bindings. We recommended you follow the official guide here: https://grpc.io/docs/quickstart/csharp.html#generate-grpc-code.

### Run the following Commands (both MacOS and Linux)

```{.copyWrapper}
cd ~/tyk-plugin
temp_dir=packages/Grpc.Tools.1.6.x/tmp
curl_url=https://www.nuget.org/api/v2/package/Grpc.Tools/
mkdir -p $temp_dir && cd $temp_dir && curl -sL $curl_url > tmp.zip; unzip tmp.zip && cd .. && cp -r tmp/tools . && rm -rf tmp && cd ../..
chmod -Rf +x packages/Grpc.Tools.1.6.x/tools/
```

Then run the following, depending on your OS:

**MacOS (x64)**

```{.copyWrapper}
export GRPC_TOOLS=packages/Grpc.Tools.1.6.x/tools/macosx_x64
```


**Linux (x64)**

```{.copyWrapper}
export GRPC_TOOLS=packages/Grpc.Tools.1.6.x/tools/linux_x64
```

The `GRPC_TOOLS` environment variable will point to the appropriate GrpcTools path that matches our operating system and architecture. The last step is to export a variable for the `protoc` program; this is the main program used to generate bindings:

```{.copyWrapper}
export GRPC_PROTOC=$GRPC_TOOLS/protoc
```

Now that we can safely run `protoc`, we can download the Tyk Protocol Buffers definition files. These files contain the data structures used by Tyk. See [Data Structures]({{< ref "plugins/supported-languages/rich-plugins/rich-plugins-data-structures" >}}) for more information:

```{.copyWrapper}
cd ~/tyk-plugin
git clone https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-protobuf
```

To generate the bindings, we create an empty directory and run the `protoc` tool using the environment variable that was set before:

```{.copyWrapper}
mkdir Coprocess
$GRPC_PROTOC -I=tyk-protobuf/proto --csharp_out=Coprocess --grpc_out=Coprocess --plugin=protoc-gen-grpc=$GRPC_TOOLS/grpc_csharp_plugin tyk-protobuf/proto/*.proto
```

Run the following command to check the binding directory:

```{.copyWrapper}
ls Coprocess
```

The output will look like this:

```
CoprocessCommon.cs      CoprocessObject.cs      CoprocessReturnOverrides.cs
CoprocessMiniRequestObject.cs   CoprocessObjectGrpc.cs              CoprocessSessionState.cs
```

### Server Implementation

Create a file called `Server.cs`.

Add the following code to `Server.cs`.

```{.copyWrapper}
using System;
using System.Threading.Tasks;
using Grpc.Core;

using Coprocess;

class DispatcherImpl : Dispatcher.DispatcherBase
{
  public DispatcherImpl()
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Instantiating DispatcherImpl");
  }


  // The Dispatch method will be called by Tyk for every configured hook, we'll implement a very simple dispatcher here:
  public override Task<Coprocess.Object> Dispatch(Coprocess.Object thisObject, ServerCallContext context)
  {
    // thisObject is the request object:
    Console.WriteLine("Receiving object: " + thisObject.ToString());

    // hook contains the hook name, this will be defined in our plugin bundle and the implementation will be a method in this class (DispatcherImpl), we'll look it up:
    var hook = this.GetType().GetMethod(thisObject.HookName);

    // If hook is null then a handler method for this hook isn't implemented, we'll log this anyway:
    if (hook == null)
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Hook name: " + thisObject.HookName + " (not implemented!)");
      // We return the unmodified request object, so that Tyk can proxy this in the normal way.
      return Task.FromResult(thisObject);
    };

    // If there's a handler method, let's log it and proceed with our dispatch work:
    Console.WriteLine("Hook name: " + thisObject.HookName + " (implemented)");

    // This will dynamically invoke our hook method, and cast the returned object to the required Protocol Buffers data structure:
    var output = hook.Invoke(this, new object[] { thisObject, context });
    return (Task<Coprocess.Object>)output;
  }

  // MyPreMiddleware implements a PRE hook, it will be called before the request is proxied upstream and before the authentication step:
  public Task<Coprocess.Object> MyPreMiddleware(Coprocess.Object thisObject, ServerCallContext context)
  {
    Console.WriteLine("Calling MyPreMiddleware.");
    // We'll inject a header in this request:
    thisObject.Request.SetHeaders["my-header"] = "my-value";
    return Task.FromResult(thisObject);
  }

  // MyAuthCheck implements a custom authentication mechanism, it will initialize a session object if the token matches a certain value:
  public Task<Coprocess.Object> MyAuthCheck(Coprocess.Object thisObject, ServerCallContext context)
  {
    // Request.Headers contains all the request headers, we retrieve the authorization token:
    var token = thisObject.Request.Headers["Authorization"];
    Console.WriteLine("Calling MyAuthCheck with token = " + token);

    // We initialize a session object if the token matches "abc123":
    if (token == "abc123")
    {
      Console.WriteLine("Successful auth!");
      var session = new Coprocess.SessionState();
      session.Rate = 1000;
      session.Per = 10;
      session.QuotaMax = 60;
      session.QuotaRenews = 1479033599;
      session.QuotaRemaining = 0;
      session.QuotaRenewalRate = 120;
      session.Expires = 1479033599;

      session.LastUpdated = 1478033599.ToString();

      thisObject.Metadata["token"] = token;
      thisObject.Session = session;
      return Task.FromResult(thisObject);

    }

    // If the token isn't "abc123", we return the request object in the original state, without a session object, Tyk will reject this request:
    Console.WriteLine("Rejecting auth!");
    return Task.FromResult(thisObject);
  }
}
```


Create a file called `Program.cs` to instantiate our dispatcher implementation and start a gRPC server.

Add the following code to `Program.cs`. 

```{.copyWrapper}
using System;
using Grpc.Core;

namespace tyk_plugin
{
  class Program
  {

    // Port to attach the gRPC server to:
    const int Port = 5555;

    static void Main(string[] args)
    {
      // We initialize a  Grpc.Core.Server and attach our dispatcher implementation to it:
      Server server = new Server
      {
          Services = { Coprocess.Dispatcher.BindService(new DispatcherImpl()) },
          Ports = { new ServerPort("localhost", Port, ServerCredentials.Insecure) }
      };
      server.Start();

      Console.WriteLine("gRPC server listening on " + Port);
      Console.WriteLine("Press any key to stop the server...");
      Console.ReadKey();

      server.ShutdownAsync().Wait();

    }
  }
}
```

To run the gRPC server use the following command from the plugin directory:

```{.copyWrapper}
dotnet run
```

The gRPC server will listen on port 5555 (as defined in `Program.cs`). In the next steps we'll setup the plugin bundle and modify Tyk to connect to our gRPC server.

## Setting up the Plugin Bundle

We need to create a manifest file within the `tyk-plugin` directory. This file contains information about our plugin and how we expect it to interact with the API that will load it. This file should be named `manifest.json` and needs to contain the following:

```{.copyWrapper}
{
  "custom_middleware": {
    "driver": "grpc",
    "auth_check": {
      "name": "MyAuthMiddleware",
      "path": "",
      "raw_body_only": false,
      "require_session": false
    }
  }
}
```

* The `custom_middleware` block contains the middleware settings like the plugin driver we want to use (`driver`) and the hooks that our plugin will expose. We use the `auth_check` hook for this tutorial. For other hooks see [here]({{ ref "plugins/supported-languages/rich-pluginsrich-plugins-work#coprocess-dispatcher-hooks" >}}).
* The `name` field references the name of the function that we implement in our plugin code - `MyAuthMiddleware`. This will be handled by our dispatcher gRPC method (implemented in `Server.cs`).
* The `path` field is the path to the middleware component.
* The `raw_body_only` field 
* The `require_session` field, if set to `true` gives you access to the session object. It will be supplied as a session variable to your middleware processor function


To bundle our plugin run the following command in the `tyk-plugin` directory. Check your tyk-cli install path first:

```{.copyWrapper}
/opt/tyk-gateway/utils/tyk-cli bundle build -y
```

From Tyk v2.8 upwards you can use:
```{.copyWrapper}
/opt/tyk-gateway/bin/tyk bundle build -y
```


A plugin bundle is a packaged version of the plugin. It may also contain a cryptographic signature of its contents. The `-y` flag tells the Tyk CLI tool to skip the signing process in order to simplify the flow of this tutorial. 

For more information on the Tyk CLI tool, see [here]({{ ref "plugins/supported-languages/rich-pluginsplugin-bundles#using-the-bundler-tool" >}}).

You should now have a `bundle.zip` file in the `tyk-plugin` directory.

## Publish the Plugin

To publish the plugin, copy or upload `bundle.zip` to a local web server like Nginx, or Apache or storage like Amazon S3. For this tutorial we'll assume you have a web server listening on `localhost` and accessible through `http://localhost`.

## What's Next?

In this tutorial we learned how Tyk gRPC plugins work. For a production-level setup we suggest the following:

* Configure an appropriate web server and path to serve your plugin bundles.
* See the following [GitHub repo](https://github.com/TykTechnologies/tyk-plugin-demo-dotnet) for a gRPC based .NET plugin that incorporates authentication based on Microsoft SQL Server.
