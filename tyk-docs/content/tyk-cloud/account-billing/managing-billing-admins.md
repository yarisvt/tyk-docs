## Introduction

This page explains what a Tyk Cloud billing admin can do as part of your API management process, giving you complete control over your API management.

As a Billing Admin you can perform the following:

* Add, edit and delete [payment methods]({{ ref "tyk-cloud/account-billing/add-payment-method" >}})
* Add further users as Billing Admins
* Upgrade or downgrade plans
