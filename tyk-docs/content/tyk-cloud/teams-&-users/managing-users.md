## Introduction

The following [user roles]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/teams-&-users/user-roles.md" >}}) can perform existing User Admin tasks:

* [Organisation Admin]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/teams-&-users/user-roles.md#user-roles-within-tyk-cloud" >}}) - Can manage all users in the organisation they are a member of.
* [Team Admin]({{< ref "tyk-cloud/teams-&-users/user-roles.md#user-roles-within-tyk-cloud" >}}) - Can only manage the users of the team they are a member of.

**Note**

Organisation Admins, Team Admins and Team Members are responsible for managing the Tyk Cloud organisation hierarchy and deploying/managing stacks, as well as having access to the Tyk Dashboard to manage APIs. Users of Tyk Cloud are usually DevOps, Architects and sometimes Engineers or Managers.

You can also [add users to the Tyk Dashboard]({{< ref "basic-config-and-security/security/dashboard/create-users" >}}) itself instead of inviting them as Tyk Cloud users. These users would likely be your API Developers and Engineers who manage the APIs.
