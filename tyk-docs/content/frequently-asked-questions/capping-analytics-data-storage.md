What methods are available to enable me to manage my MongoDB analytics storage?

[Time Based Caps]({{ ref "tyk-pumpcapping-analytics-data-storage#a-name-time-based-cap-a-time-based-cap" >}})

[Size Based Caps]({{ ref "tyk-pumpcapping-analytics-data-storage#a-name-size-based-cap-a-size-based-cap" >}})

**Note**  

Time based caps (TTL indexes) are incompatible with already configured size based caps.

If you are using DocumentDB, capped collections are not supported. See [here](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/documentdb/latest/developerguide/mongo-apis.html) for more details.
