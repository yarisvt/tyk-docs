    ## <a name="introduction"></a> Introduction
    The Tyk Enterprise Developer Portal Management API offers programmatic access to all portal resources that your instance of the portal manages. This API repeats functionality of the user interface and enables APIs consumers integrating their portal instances with their other IT systems such as billings, CRMs, ITSM systems and other software.
    
    ## Authentication
    This API requires an admin authorisation token that is available for admin users of the portal in the profile page.

        This endpoint uploads a theme that is archived as a zip file to the portal.

        If a theme with this name already exists in the portal, the uploaded theme will replace the existing theme. Otherwise, a new theme will be created.

        The name of a theme is stored in the `name` field of `theme.json`.
